#### GPS

The GPS implementation is based on MTK connectivity chip MT6631 (U5003) supporting GPS, Galileo, Glonass and Beidou. It can receive GPS, Galileo, Beidou / Glonass simultaneously for more accurate positioning. But there is no GPS antenna on the board. You need to connect an external antenna to the RF connector CON5006.

### HDMI 

- The 96Boards specification calls for an HDMI port to be present on the board. The MT6797 doesn’t include a built-in HDMI interface.
- The MediaTek X20 Development Board deploys the built-in DPI interface as the source for the HDMI output. A peripheral Bridge IC (U6502, MT8193) performs this task and it supports a resolution from 480i to 1080p at 30Hz. 

### MIPI-DSI

- The 96Boards specification calls for a MIPI-DSI implementation via the High Speed Expansion Connector. 
- The MediaTek X20 Development Board implements a 4-lane MIPI_DSI interface meeting this requirement. It can support up to FHD(1080p@60fps). The MediaTek X20 Development Board routes the MIPI_DSI interface signals to the DSI-0 interface of the MT6797.

### Camera Interface

- The 96Boards specification calls for two camera interfaces.
- The MediaTek X20 Development Board supports two camera interfaces, one with a 4-lane MIPI_CSI interface and one with 2-lane MIPI_CSI interface, meeting this requirement. The 4-lane MIPI_CSI interface can support 25M camera and the 2-lane MIPI_CSI interface can support 8M camera. 

### USB Ports

The MediaTek X20 Development Board supports a USB device port and three USB host ports via a USB MUX(U6503). The input channel( D+/D-) of USB MUX is connected to the P0 port of the SOC MT6797, and the two output channels(1D+/1D-,2D+/2D-) are connected to micro USB port and USB hub respectively. The three USB host ports are connected to the downstream ports of the USB hub.The control of U6503 is done via a software controlled GPIO (USB_SW_SEL, EINT9 from the SOC MT6797). When this signal is logic low, ‘0’, the USB data lines are routed to the Micro USB connector and the MT6797 P0 port is set to device mode. When ‘USB_SW_SEL’ is logic level high, ‘1’, the USB data lines are routed to U6401 (a 3-port USB HUB) and the MT6797 P0 port is set to host mode. The user can overwrite the software control by sliding switch 3 of dip-switch SW3205 to the ‘ON’ position. That action forces the USB–MUX (U6503) to route the USB data lines to the USB HUB. The overwrite option exists for the host mode only, you cannot hardware overwrite the MUX to force device mode.

The microphone signals are routed to the MT6351 built-in Audio CODEC. It is an uplink input channel and it can be connected to a MIC or a codec line out. The signals are:  
- AU_VIN0_P  
- AU_VIN0_N
- MICBIAS0(The bias voltage output step size is 0.1V, the range is 1.7~2.1V/2.5~2.7V)

### Earphone 
The earphone signals are routed from the MT6351 built-in Audio CODEC. It can support stereo earphone directly (Single-ended Output, RLOAD=16/32Ω). The singles are: 
- AU_HPL
- AU_HPR
- ACCDET1
- AU_VIN0_P  
- AU_VIN0_N
- MICBIAS0

There are two ways (ACC mode and DCC mode ) to detect the accessory. In DCC mode, the ACCDET1 is not use. And the system can detect the earphone inserting via a EINT (External interrupt GPIO of MT6797 ). In ACC mode, the ACCDET1 should be connected to the positive of MIC input signals (between the bypass capacitor and the earphone jack). It is used to detect the Up key, Down Key and Hook key. For the earphone inserting detection, you also need to use an EINT GPIO.
The main parameters are list in table below.

|    Parameter                                 | Min. | Typ. | Max. | Unit |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|4-pole Microphone Detection	|2K|		|14K|	Ω|
|Microphone impedance detection after 4-pole Microphone plugged-in|
|MICD_LVL[0]: Up key	|400|	|	620|	Ω|
|MICD_LVL[1]: Down key	|150|		|320|	Ω|
|MICD_LVL[2]:Hook key	|0	|	|100|	Ω|
*Load impedance detection range (ACCDET1) by 1&1.5kΩ (1%) MICBIAS resistors.

### Headset 
The headset signals are routed from the MT6351 built-in Audio CODEC. It can support 16/32Ω receiver directly. The singles are: 
- AU_HSP
- AU_HSN 

### FM Antenna 
The FM antenna signals are routed to the MT6631 (U5003), an integrated connectivity device. The two signals below should be kept in differential trace to audio jack. 
- FM_ANT
- FM_RX_N_6631

### DC Power Input

- An 8V to 18V power from a dedicated DC jack J901. 
- An 8V to 18V power from the SYS_DCIN pins on the Low Speed Expansion Connector CON7001. 

> Note: Please refer to the mechanical size of the DC plug below.The inside diameter of the plug is 1.7mm，the outer diameter of the plug is 4.75mm.The positive electrode of the DC plug is in the inside, and the negative pole is outside.

### Power Source Selection and Sequencing

The user of the MediaTek X20 Development Board should never apply power to the board from J901 and the Low Speed Expansion connector at the same time. There is no active or passive mechanism on the MediaTek X20 Development Board to prioritize one source over the other.
