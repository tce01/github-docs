# Wireless Network

The HiKey board includes built in [2.4GHz IEEE802.11 b/g/n WiFi networking](http://www.ti.com/product/WL1835MOD). The board does not support the 5GHz band. To use the wireless LAN interface for the first time (or to switch wireless networks) you should click on the wireless LAN icon on the bottom right of the desktop display. The yellow LED between the microUSB and the Type A USB on the front board edge indicates wireless network activity.

You can configure the network from UI, or manually from console:

```
$ sudo nmtui
```

Select 'Activate a connection', Choose your WiFi access point (SSID) and fill the relevant information (password, etc...)

You can check network status by issuing this command.
```
$ sudo nmcli dev wifi
```
