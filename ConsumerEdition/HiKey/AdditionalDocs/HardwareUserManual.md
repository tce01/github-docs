## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Before you power up your HiKey board for the first time you will need the following:

- HiKey board.
- A power supply with 12V@2A (suggested).
- A HDMI or DVI LCD Monitor.
- HDMI-HDMI cable or HDMI-DVI cable to connect the board to the Monitor.
- A computer keyboard with USB interface.
- A computer mouse with USB interface.

#### Known Limitations

- The microUSB OTG port may be used (in host or slave mode) or the Type A host ports may be used. They may not​both be used simultaneously. If a cable is inserted into the OTG port then the Type A ports and the expansion bus port will be automatically disabled.
- For the microUSB OTG port a single Low Speed (1.5Mbit/sec), Full Speed (12Mbit/sec) or High Speed (480Mbit/sec) device is supported.
- For the USB host ports all attached USB devices must be one of the following three options: Low Speed (1.5Mbit/sec) and Full Speed (12Mbit/sec) devices, or High Speed devices (480Mbit/sec).

If a mixture of High Speed and Low/Full speed devices are attached the devices will not
operate correctly. This also applies if any hubs are attached to the ports.


#### Starting the board for the first time 

To start the board, follow these simple steps:

1.  Connect the HDMI cable to the HiKey HDMI connector and to the LCD
Monitor.
2. Connect the keyboard to the boards USB connector and the mouse to the USB
connector.
3. Closed the auto power jumper, please see the “Jumpers/Switch
Configuration”.
4. Connect the power supply to power connector P301.

Once you plug the power supply into a power outlet the board will start the booting
process, and you should see Debian/Android boot up.

Correspondingly there're also 3-channel 32K digital clock output, 5-channel 19.2M analog
clock output, and 1-channel 19.2M digital clock output.

### Memory (DRAM)

The HiKey (LeMaker version) uses a LPDDR3 DRAM chip as the memory. It provides 1GB or
2GB DRAM memory to satisfy the different requirements. a single embedded Multi Chip
Package (eMCP) dual function LPDDR3/eMMC memory solution.
The LPDDR3 is a 32bit width bus implementation interfacing directly to the Kirin 620
build-in LPDDR controller. The maximum DDR clock is 800Mhz.
We can distinguish the memory capacity by the footprint on the memory chip:

| Serial                       | Size    |
|:-----------------------------|:-------:|
| K4E**8**E304EE-EGCE          | 1GB     |
| K4E**6**E304EE-EGCE          | 2GB     |


### Storage

#### eMMC

The Hikey (LeMaker version) has an on-board 8GB eMMC nand flash. The eMMC is an 8bit
implementation interfacing with Kirin 620 eMMC interface supporting eMMC 4.5
specifications. and supports 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit modes.

#### Micro SDHC

The microSDHC socket is on the bottom left corner of the PCB and is routed directly to the
Kirin 620 SD 3.0 interface, and supports 1-bit and 4-bit modes (3 V and 1.8 V supported for
the I/O device). The slot is a push-push type with a dedicated support for card detect signal.

### Boot ROM

The MediaTek X20 Development Board boots up from the EMMC.

### Networking

#### WiFi/Bluetooth LE

The HiKey board uses a TI WL1835MOD WLAN Baseband Processor and RF Transceiver
which supports IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 (including low
energy).

More features about the TI WL1835MOD can refer to:

http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/WL18xx_Overview

### Display Interface

As a display channel of the HI6220V100 chip, the ADE overlays graphics layers,and controls
display timings. The ADE supports the RGB parallel interface that can connect to display
interface IPs such as the MIPI DSI and HDMI.
Below is a block diagram of the HiKey implementation.

<img src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/DisplayInterface.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/DisplayInterface.png" width="750" height="480" />

#### HDMI 

The Kirin 620 doesn’t include a built-in HDMI interface. The Kirin 620 deploys the built-in
MIPI-DSI 4 lanes interface as the source for the HDMI output. A peripheral DSI to HDMI
Bridge (Analog Devices ADV7533) performs this task and it supports a resolution from 480i
to 1080p at 30Hz.While
the ADV7533 supports automatic input video form at timing
detection (CEA-861E), an I2C channel from the Kirin 620 allows the user to configure the
operation of this bridge. This bridge supports audio as well (meeting the 96Boards
requirements to provide audio via HDMI). Please
note that the 96Boards specification calls
for a MIPI-DSI interface to be routed to the High Speed Expansion connector. Since the Kirin
620 has only one MIPI-DSI interface. A mux device (FSA644UCX) is being used on the board.
Only one interface, HDMI, or the Expansion MIPI-DSI can be active at a given time. The
controlling signal is named‘ DSI_SEL_GPIO0_1’. When this signal is logic low, ‘0’, the MIPI-DSI
is routed to the DSI-HDMI Bridge. When‘ DSI_SEL_GPIO0_1’ is logic level high, ‘1’, the
MIPI-DSI is routed to the High Speed Expansion connector.

#### MIPI-DSI

Expansion connector.The Kirin 620 implemented a four-lane MIPI_DSI interface meeting
this requirement. More information about this implementation can be found in [High Speed
Expansion Connector]().

### Camera Interface

The HiKey board implements two camera interfaces, one with a four-lane MIPI_CSI interface
and one with a two-lane MIPI_CSI interface, meeting this requirement. More information
about this implementation can be found in [High Speed Expansion Connector]().

### USB Ports

There are a total of 4 USB ports on the HiKey board. Two Type-A host ports at J401 and
J403, one microUSB AB 2.0 host/slave port at J402 and one USB host port available on the
High Speed Expansion bus. The following block diagram shows the HiKey board
implementation:

<img src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/USBPorts.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/USBPorts.png" width="750" height="480" />

The HiKey board utilizes a single SoC USB interface without USB protocol hardware split
transfer support. The USB interfaces are therefore subject to the following restrictions:

- Either the microUSB or the Type A and LS expansion USB interfaces may be used at a time, depending on the state of USB_SEL_GPIO0_3. Both interfaces may not be used at the same time.
- The microUSB port supports a single attached device with USB slave operations or USB host high speed, full speed or low speed operations.
- The Type A and LS expansion USB interface cannot support mixed speed devices. All attached devices must be of the same type – high speed, full speed or low speed.Furthermore, the HiKey board must be configured in software to support either full speed/low speed devices (default) or high speed devices on these ports.

### Audio

The HiKey board uses HDMI audio as the audio output. It also has a PCM channel on the Low Speed Expansion connector.

### DC Power

The 96Boards specification calls for power to be provided to the board in one of the
following ways:

- An 8V to 18V power from a dedicated DC jack .
- An 8V to 18V power from the SYS_DCIN pins on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- Powering via USB is forbidden.

An 8V up to 18V power supply at a minimum of 2A rating can be used to provide sufficient board power for on system requirements as well as external devices. Additional current rating may be required for mezzanine boards or modules. DC Power can also be supplied via the SYS_DCIN pins on the low speed expansion. Please see the detail information in the DC Power Input section for detailed information on Kirin 620 implementation of DC Power.

### Power Measurement

The 96Boards specification calls for support for measuring power consumptions of the
board. Please see the detail information in the [Power Management](#power-management) section for the HiKey
Power Measurement implementation.

### External Fan Connection

The HiKey board can drive 5V or 12V cooling fans. The power for these is available on the low speed Expansion connector and can be supplied through a 2-pin 2mm male header inserted at pins SYS_5V or SYSDC_IN.

### UART

The HiKey board also has an option for a Debug UART Header. This is normally used by the first stage bootloader developers, and is connected to the UART0 port of the SoC. This is available if a 2x2 male header is installed at J801. See below for the pin out of this header.

<img src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/UART.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/UART.png" width="100" height="140" />

| Signal   | Pin  | Pin  | Signal    |
|:---------|:----:|:----:|----------:|
| 1.8V     | 1    | 2    | UART0_RX  |
| DGND     | 3    | 4    | UART0_TX  |

And HiKey also has other UART(UART2 and UART3) on the Low Speed Expansion connector.

> Please note:​at now all the Linaro reference build Linux distribution will use the UART3 on the HiKey board as the debug UART

### Buttons

The 96Boards specification calls for the present of two buttons, a Power on/sleep button and a Reset button. The HiKey meets these requirements. The power button S601 can be used to power up, power down, and reset the system. The circuit is designed such that the user will be able to manually power up, down and reset the board.

- A press and hold will power off the board if the Auto Power Jumper is not installed.
- A press and release will then power off the board.
- A press and hold for >4 seconds will reset the board.

It is also possible to connect external switches for power on/off and for hard reset.

### LED Indicators

The 96Boards specifications calls for six LEDs to be implemented on the board. The
specification defines the LEDs color and mechanical location on the board. There are two
status LEDs and four User LEDs on the HiKey board. The user LEDs can be programmed by
the SoC directly.

#### Two activity LEDs

- The WiFi activity LED is a Yellow type surface mount 0603 LED. The WIFI LED on the HiKey is located beside the BT LED, this LED reflects the status of the Wi-Fi device.
- The BT activity LED is a Blue Type surface mount 0603 LED. The BT LED on the HiKey board is located next to the USB OTG connector; this LED reflects the status of the Bluetooth device.

#### Four User LEDs

The four user LEDs are surface mount Green Type 0603 LED.

### Additional Functionality

#### JTAG

The HiKey board includes the option for soldering a 10 pin header that brings out the SoC signals for JTAG debug. A FTSH-105-01-F-DV header can be populated at J803.

## Expansion Connectors

The HiKey board features two expansion connectors: one low speed expansion connector and one high speed.

### Low Speed Expansion Connector

The low speed expansion connector carries GPIO and other low speed interfaces. The connector is a low profile 40 pin female 2mm receptacle (20x2) of a specified height of 4.5mm height. The low speed expansion brings out 1.8V level SoC signals such as UART2 and UART3, I2C0 and I2C1, GPIO signals as well as SPI, PCM, Reset, 1.8V and Ground.

<img src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/LowSpeed_Connector.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/LowSpeed_Connector.png" width="500" height="100" />

multiplexed with other functional pins.

### SPI 0 

The HiKey board implements a full SPI master with 4 wires, CLK, CS, MOSI and MISO all
connect directly to the Kirin 620.

### PCM

The HiKey board implements a PCM with 3 wires, CLK, FS and DO, the optional DI signal is
not implemented on the HiKey board. The I2S signals are connected directly to the Kirin
620.

### Power and Reset 

The 96Boards specification calls for a signal on the Low Speed Expansion Connector that can power on/off the board and a signal that serves as a board reset signal. 
The MediaTek X20 Development Board routes the PWR_BTN_N (named PWRKEY on schematic) signal to the PWRKEY pin of the PMIC MT6351. This signal is driven by SW3201 as well, the on-board power on push-button switch.  A mezzanine implementation of this signals should not drive it with any voltage, the only allowed operation is to force it to GND to start the board from a sleep mode. 
The MediaTek X20 Development Board routes the RST_BTN_N (named SYSRSTB on schematic) signal to the SYSRSTB pin of the PMIC MT6351.

### Power Supplies 

The HiKey board routes the PMU_PWRON_N signal to the PWRON_N pin of the
HI6553V100 PMIC. This signal is driven by S601 as well, the on-board power on push-button
switch.

The HiKey board routes the EXP_RSTOUT_N signal to the RSTOUT_N pin of the
HI6553V100 PMIC.

### MIPI DSI 2 

The 96Boards specification calls for a MIPI-DSI to be present on the High Speed Expansion
Connector. A minimum of one lane is required and up to four lanes can be accommodated
on the connector.

The HiKey board implementation supports a full four lane MIPI-DSI interface that is routed
to the High Speed Expansion Connector. Since the Kirin 620 has only single MIPI-DSI
interface and it may be used to drive the DSI-HDMI Bridge, DSI Muxing is required.
A mux device, U1702 (FSA644UCK) is used on the board. Only one interface, HDMI, or the
Expansion MIPI-DSI can be active at a given time. The controlling signal is named ‘
DSI_SEL_GPIO0_1’. When this signal is logic low, ‘0’, the MIPI-DSI is routed to the DSI-HDMI
Bridge.

When ‘ DSI_SEL_GPIO0_1’ is logic level high, ‘1’, the MIPI-DSI is routed to the High Speed
Expansion connector.

### MIPI CSI {0/1} 

The 96Boards specification calls for two MIPI-CSI interfaces to be present on the High

Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional. CSI0 interface can be up to four
lanes while CSI1 is up to two lanes.

The current HiKey board implementation supports a full four-lane MIPI-CSI interface on
CSI0 and a two-lane of MIPI-CSI on CSI1. All MIPI-CSI signals are routed directly to/from the
Kirin 620.

### USB

The 96Boards specification calls for a USB data line interface to be present on the High
Speed Expansion Connector. The HiKey board implements this requirements by routing
USB channel 3 from the USB HUB to the High Speed Expansion Connector.

## Power Management Overview

### Block Diagram

<img src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/PowetManagement.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/PowetManagement.png" width="750" height="480" />

The 96Boards specification defines how power arrives to the board and few supplies that
the board needs to provide. The on board power requirement for each 96Boards
implementation depends on the SoC and the set of peripherals that are specific to that
implementation.
The HiKey board uses two buck regulators, U302 and U301. U302 takes the power into the
board and generates 5V at 4A. This voltage feeds the USB HOST power limit switches and
provides power to the Low Speed Expansion port. U301 takes the power into the board and
generates 4.2V at 4A. This voltage serves as the power in voltage to the on-board PMIC,
HI6553V100. The HI6553V100 can generate 22 different voltage rails.

### DC Power Input

The HiKey board can be powered from one of the following ways： power to be provided in
one of the following ways:

1. 8V to 18V supply from a dedicated DC jack.
The HiKey board supports this requirement through the use of P301, ‘SYS_DCIN’
power connector.

> Please note: ​the SYS_DCIN can be as low as 6.5V on the HiKey board. The power
supply which is used to power the board from the DC jack should be positive outside
and negative inside.

2. 8V to 18V supply from the SYS_DCIN pins on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
The HiKey board supports incoming power through this connector.

> Please note:​the SYS_DCIN can be as low as 6.5V on the HiKey board.


### Power Source Selection and Sequencing

The HiKey board has only two sources for board incoming power. The 96Boards
specification calls for only one power source to be applied to the board at any given time.
Following this requirement, the user of the HiKey board should never apply power to the
board from P301 and the SYS_DCIN on the Low Speed Expansion connector at the same
time. There is no active or passive mechanism on the HiKey board to prioritize one source
over the other.

### Power Measurements

The HiKey board supports power measurement for instrumentation and testing. 0.001ohm
1206 sense resistors can be used. Installed at specific locations in place of the 0Ωresistors
currently populated on the board. To connect to these sense resistors, the PCB provides
footprints for 100mm 2-pin headers that can be installed. For voltage measurements,
digital GND is provided on the low speed expansion connector.The HiKey board was designed to
provide current measurements for the following rails:

| Resistor | Header | Rail       | Measurement                 |
|:--------:|:------:|:-----------|:----------------------------|
| R302     | J301   | DC_IN      | Total Base Board Power      |
| R306     |        | VDD_4V2    | PMIC                        |
| R305     |        | SYS_5V     | HDMI, USB                   |
