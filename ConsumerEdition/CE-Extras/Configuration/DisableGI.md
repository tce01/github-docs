# Disabling graphics interface (Debian)

When the graphics interface is not really needed (e.g. using as a server), it's just better to disable the entire X11 stack to reduce the amount of memory and cpu used by the system.

**To disable X11 on boot:**

```shell
root@linaro-alip:~# systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

**To enable X11 again:**

```shell
root@linaro-alip:~# systemctl set-default graphical.target
```
