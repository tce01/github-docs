# Advanced Guide

In this guide you will learn where to acquire, and how to build the various 96Boards enabled libraries such as 96BoardsGPIO, libsoc, MRAA, and UPM. Users who are interested in building their own libraries should be comfortable with building from source, and should already be familiar with the 96Boards hardware.

Before jumping to the library installation sections, you must first set up your 96Boards device with an up-to-date package list, the appropriate package dependencies, and configuration files.

## Update 96Boards system

The image on your board might be out of date. This is possible even when using the stock image (the operating system your board was shipped with), or a newly flashed version from the 96Boards.org website. 

A few useful commands will help us make sure everything on the board is current:

- **apt-get update**: Downloads package lists from online repositories and "updates" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.
- **apt-get upgrade**: Fetches and installs newest package versions which currently exist on the system. APT must know about these new versions by way of 'apt-get update'
- **apt-get dist-upgrade**: In addition to performing the function of upgrade, this option also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages

**Commands:**

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get upgrade

$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

Note: If at any point during this process you are prompted with a 'Y/N', select Y and press Enter.

## Install package dependencies

Building the GPIO libraries is easy as long all the necessary tools are present. Installing all the package dependencies is a crucial step which will ensure our libraries build properly

**Package dependencies list:**

- **git**: A version control system which is widely used for software development and other version control tasks
- **build-essential**: This package contains an informational list of packages which are considered essential for building Debian packages
- **autoconf**: A tool for producing shell scripts which automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Posix-like systems
- **automake**: A programming tool to automate parts of the compilation process
- **libtool**: An important portability utility. It gives a common interface to the mechanics of building, debugging and maintaining static and dynamic libraries on most computer systems in use
- **swig3.0**: A software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages
- **python-dev**: Contains the header files you need to build Python extensions
- **nodejs-dev**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- **cmake**: A Makefile generator
- **pkg-config**: A computer program that provides a unified interface for querying installed libraries for the purpose of compiling software from its source code
- **libpcre3-dev**: This is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language

**Commands:**

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git build-essential autoconf automake libtool swig3.0 python-dev nodejs-dev cmake pkg-config libpcre3-dev

$ sudo apt-get clean
```

Note: If at any point during this process you are prompted with a 'Y/N', select Y and press Enter.

## Install 96Boards configuration files

As root and using your favorite text editor edit /etc/profile.d/96boards-sensors.sh and add/update the following lines (This example uses “vi” text editor):


**Step 1:** Using git, clone the 96Boards-tools repository to your device and copy the respective files to your '/etc/udev/' directory

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/96boards/96boards-tools.git

$ sudo cp 96boards-tools/70-96boards-common.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

**Step 2:** As root, and using your favorite text editor, edit /etc/profile.d/96boards-sensors.sh and add the following lines (This example uses “vi” text editor):

```shell
#EDIT THIS FILE
$ sudo vi /etc/profile.d/96boards-sensors.sh
```

```shell
#ADD THESE LINES
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=”-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/tty96B0”
export MONITOR_PORT=/dev/tty96B0
export PYTHONPATH=”$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages”
```

```shell
#COPY FILE TO NEW LOCATION
$ sudo cp /etc/profile.d/96boards-sensors.sh /etc/X11/Xsession.d/96boards-sensors
```

## Install Libraries

This sections will show you how to install and build each library individually. Simple choose the library you wish to learn about and follow the instructions provided.

> Note: 96BoardsGPIO is dependent on the libsoc library, UPM is depended on the MRAA library.

Please take some time to explore the libraries' repositories to read about them and how they differ from eachother. There is no need to build and install all libraries, only the ones you plan on using.

- libsoc ([Build Instructions](libsoc-install/README.md) / [Read More](https://github.com/jackmitch/libsoc))
   - This C library can interface with common peripherals found in
System on Chips through generic Linux Kernel interfaces.
- 96BoardsGPIO ([Build Instructions](96BoardsGPIO-install/README.md) / [Read More](https://github.com/96boards/96BoardsGPIO))
   - A rudimentary library, capable of controlling real world hardware via the GPIO on the 96Boards family of boards. Must conform to the CE specification. Dependent on libsoc library.
- MRAA ([Build Instructions](MRAA-install/README.md) / [Read More](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa))
   - C/C++ library with bindings to javascript & python to interface with the IO on your 96Boards
- UPM ([Build Instructions](UPM-install/README.md) / [Read More](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm))
   - High level repository for sensors which use MRAA. Dependent on MRAA library
