### Audio
The 96Boards specifications call for a minimum of single channel audio through two interfaces, BT and HDMI/MHL/DisplayPort.

The B2260 Development Board has 3 audio ports: USB (I/O), HDMI and PCM/I2S (I/O) ports.

#### PCM/I2S Uniperipheral player
Generic audio player :
- receives PCM audio data or audio encoded bit stream data from the memory (via FDMA),
-  performs optional IEC-60958 formatting on the audio data,
-  sends them out on the I2S output.


- Number of channels can be 2, 4, 6 or 8,
-	Max frequency supported in 192 kHz,
-	Support for I2S/Sony mode,
-	Support IEC-60958 and IEC-61937 format (encoding is done by software),
-	Uniplayer feature: “Standby” mode (generates silence and clocks to avoid glitches).

#### PCM/I2S Uniperipheral reader
Generic audio reader:
- receives the PCM audio or encoded bit stream on the I2S input interface,
- writes the processed data in memory (via FDMA).


-	Number of channels can be 2, 4, 6 or 8,
-	Max frequency supported in 192 kHz,
-	Support for I2S/Sony mode,
-	Support IEC-60958 and IEC-61937 format (encoding is done by software),
-	Unireader limitation: Need to provide external Master clocks ( I2S OUT mclk or independent clock).

#### USB Audio
The Audio USB is implemented on B2260 Development Board.
Only the Digital audio USB profile is supported (input and output).

#### HDMI Audio
The B2260 Development Board supports the HDMI (HDMI standard) 1.4, up to 8 channels (PCM or encoded samples), output only.

The sample frequency can be set up to 192 kHz.

### DC Power
The 96Boards specification mandates power to be provided in one of the following ways :
-	8V to 18V supply from a dedicated DC jack
-	8V to 18V supply from the SYS_DCIN pins on the Low Speed Expansion Connector

There is no Type C USB on the B2260 Development board.<br>
The B2260 Development board achieves the requirement and extends the range from 4.2 to 18V.

### Power Measurement
The total board power consumption can be measured thanks to the low ohmic resistor R575 located at the left side of the DC Jack connector.

### External Fan Connection
Dedicated power supply, 5V and 12V, are provided on the Low speed connector to enable the connection of any 5V or 12V Fan.

### UART
The 96Boards specification requires one SoC UART and an optional second UART, both of them will be routed to the Low Speed Expansion Connector.<br>

The B2260 boards meets those two requirements, and the UART 0 and UART 1 can be accessed directly on the Low Speed Expansion Connector. Please see Low Speed Expansion Connector table for more information.**


### Buttons
The 96Boards specify the present of two buttons, a Power on/sleep button and a Reset button.

The B2260 Development Board presents only one button. The power on button is not necessary because when B2260 Development Board is supplied, the board boots automatically. <br>
The RESET signals is also routed to the Low Speed Expansion connector.

One button is available for Board Reset, the connector J1 (component 12 of Key Components section).
The user will press one second on this button to reset the Board.

### LED Indicators
The 96Boards specify for six LEDs to be implemented on the board.
The specification defines the LEDs color and mechanical location on the board.
All the LEDs are driven by the B2260 Development Board GPIOs.

The B2260 Development Board has two activity LEDs for WiFi and BT activities and four user LEDS.

#### Two activity LEDs
They are located between the micro USB connector and the USB A connector:
-	WiFi activity LED Yellow, driven by PIO4-0.
- BT activity LED Blue, driven by PIO3-3.

#### Four User LEDs
They are located between the two USB type A connectors:
-	User Led Green 1 driven by PIO1-3
-	User Led Green 2 driven by PIO4-1
-	User Led Green 3 driven by PIO2-1
-	User Led Green 4 driven by PIO2-5

### JTAG
The 96Boards specification does not call for a dedicated JTAG connector. However the B2260 Development Board has JTAG signal routed to J2.<br>
The J2 connector has a standard 10 pins JTAG connector pitch and is populated on the board as follow.

### PCM/I2S
The 96Boards specification calls for one PCM/I2S bus to be provided on the Low Speed Expansion Connector. The CLK, FS and DO signals are required while the DI is optional.

The B2260 Board implements a PCM/I2S interface with 4 wires, CLK, FS, DO and DI. The signals are connected directly to the Cannes2-STiH410 SoC.

### Reset
The 96Boards specification calls for a signal on the Low Speed Expansion Connector that can power on/off the board and a signal that serves as a board reset signal.

The B2260 Development Board routes the RST_BTN_N signal to the Cannes2-STiH410 SoC.

### Power Supplies
The 96Boards specification calls for three power rails to be present on the Low Speed Expansion Connector:
- +1.8V  Max of 100mA
- +5V  Provide a minimum of 5W of power (1A).

The B2260 Development Board reaches those requirements.

#### MIPI DSI 0
The 96Boards specification calls for a MIPI-DSI to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. A minimum of one lane is required and up to four lanes can be accommodated on the connector.

The B2260 Development Board implementation doesn't support this requirement.

#### MIPI CSI {0/1}
The 96Boards specification calls for two MIPI-CSI interfaces to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional. CSI0 interface can be up to four lanes while CSI1 is up to two lanes.

The B2260 Development Board implementation doesn't support this requirement.

#### I2C {2/3}
The 96Boards specification calls for two I2C interfaces to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional unless a MIPI-CSI interface has been implemented. Then an I2C interface shall be implemented.

The B2260 Development Board implementation supports 2 I2C interfaces.

#### SD/SPI
The 96Boards specification calls for an SD interface or a SPI port to be part of the High Speed Expansion Connector.

The B2260 Development Board implementation supports SD interface.

#### Clocks
The 96Boards specification calls for one or two programmable clock interfaces to be provided on the High Speed Expansion Connector. These clocks may have a secondary function of being CSI0_MCLK and CSI1_MCLK. If these clocks can’t be supported by the SoC than an alternative GPIO or No-Connect is allowed by the specifications.

The B2260 Development Board implementation doesn't support this requirement as neither MIPI-CSI nor MIPI-DSI is supported.

#### USB
The 96Boards specification calls for a USB Data line interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.

The B2260 Development Board implements this requirement by routing USB channel 3 from the USB HUB to the High Speed Expansion Connector.**

#### HSIC
The 96Boards specification calls for an optional MIPI-HSIC interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.

The B2260 Development Board implementation doesn't support this requirement.

## Power Management Overview
### Block Diagram

<img src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/B2260/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/PowerManagementBlockDiagram.png?raw=true" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/B2260/AdditionalDocs/Images/Images_HWUserManual/PowerManagementBlockDiagram.png?raw=true" width="612
" height="613" />

### DC Power Input
The power is provided to the system by 5 power Bucks (identified by DC/DC boxes on the scheme above) :
- one for the 5V,
- one for the 3.3V,
- one for the CPU,
- one for the Core,
- one for the LMI domain.

The 1.8V is provided by an LDO that use the 3.3V. All the Bucks operated immediately when the DC power is applied on the CN5 Jack or on SYSTEM_12V_DCIN pins on the Low Speed connector.

### Power Source Selection and Sequencing
B2260 Development Board doesn’t propose any power selection scenario.

**Therefore the user should never apply at the same time power on the board from the Low Speed Expansion connector (only the SYS_DCIN_12V) and from the DC jack CN5.**

Please note that on the B2260 Development Board, the power can be as lower as 4.2V

### Voltage Rails
Please note that there is no independent power domain on the B2260 Development Board therefore no power sequencing. When the SYS_DCIN_12V is powered from 4.2V to 18V, all the Bucks will operate therefore feeding all powers domains.
