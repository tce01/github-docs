**IMPORTANT NOTES**

- HDMI EDID display data is used to determine the best display resolution. On monitors and TVs that support 1080p (or 1200p) this resolution will be selected. If 1080p is not supported the next available resolution reported by EDID will be used. This selected mode will work with most but not all monitors/TVs.

## Starting the board for the first time
MicroSD card comes preloaded with Debian Linux and can be up and running with a few simple steps:

- Connect the B2260 to your display with the HDMI cable
  - It is important to do this first because the monitor will not detect the board if it is connected after starting
  - Ensure that the source for the display is switched to the HDMI port you are using
- Connect the USB keyboard and mouse to the USB Type-A connectors
- Insert the populated Micro SD card

> Note: The above setup will cause B2260 Board to Auto Power up when it is plugged into power

- Connect the power supply to the B2260
  - The board will begin to boot Debian Linux after a few seconds
