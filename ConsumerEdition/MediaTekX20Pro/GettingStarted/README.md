**IMPORTANT NOTES**

- Uncommon BPS rate of 921600.
- HDMI EDID display data is used to determine the best display resolution. On monitors and TVs that support 1080p(or less) this resolution will be selected. This selected mode will work with most but not all monitors/TVs. See below for further information on what to do if your monitor/TV does not display the UI.
There are limitations on the usage of the USB ports on the MediaTek X20 Development Board. Please refer to the Hardware section in the document for further information.

## Starting the board for the first time

**The MediaTek X20 comes preloaded with Android and can be up and running with a few simple steps**

- Connect the HDMI cable to the MediaTek X20 Development Board connector (marked CON6501) and to the LCD Monitor
- Set the the third pin (USB HOST SET) of switch SW3205 to the position ON and connect the keyboard to USB connector marked CON6402 and the mouse to the USB connector marked CON6401 (It doesn’t matter which order you connect them in.)
- Plug the power supply into the power outlet
- Press down the button (marked SW3201), and keep more than 3 seconds, the Android system will start

> Note: If set the first pin (AUTO_BOOT_SET) of switch SW3205 to the position ON, the Android system will start automatically when the power supply is plugged into the power outlet.
