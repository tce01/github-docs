### USB Ports

The MediaTek X20 Professional Board supports a USB device port and three USB host ports via a USB MUX(U6503). The input channel( D+/D-) of USB MUX is connected to the P0 port of the Soc MT6797, and the two output channels(1D+/1D-,2D+/2D-) are connected to micro USB port and USB hub respectively. The three USB host ports are connected to the downstream ports of the USB hub. The control of U6503 is done via a software controlled GPIO (USB_SW_SEL, EINT9 from the Soc MT6797). When this signal is logic low, ‘0’, the USB data lines are routed to the Micro USB connector and the MT6797 P0 port is set to device mode. When ‘USB_SW_SEL’ is logic level high, ‘1’, the USB data lines are routed to U6401 (a 3-port USB HUB) and the MT6797 P0 port is set to host mode. 
The user can overwrite the software control by sliding the switch 3 of the dip-switch SW3205 to the ‘ON’ position. That action forces the USB–MUX (U6503) to route the USB data lines to the USB HUB. The overwrite option exists for the host mode only, you cannot hardware overwrite the MUX to force device mode. 
If the switch 1 and 3 of the dip-switch SW3205 are both on the 'OFF' position, the software is set to the HOST mode by default. But, when a device is plugged into the MICRO USB port CON6403 (Voltage 5V is detected on VBUS by MT6351), the software is automatically switched to the device mode and the MUX(U6503) is switched to micro USB port. When the device is removed(There is no voltage detected on VBUS by MT6351), it is returned to the HOST mode and the MUX(U6503) is switched to USB hub, then the three host ports are available.
If the switch 1 of the dip-switch SW3205 is on the 'ON' position and the switch 3 of the dip-switch SW3205 is on the 'OFF' position, the software is set to device mode. At this time, if you want to use the host mode, you need to force the switch 3 of the dip-switch SW3205 to the 'ON' position.

#### Dip-switch

There is a four-channel dip-switch(SW3205) on the board.

- Channel 1:”AUTO BOOT” used to boot the board automatically. If set the switch on , the system will start automatically when the power supply is plugged into the power outlet. 
- Channel 2:NC.
- Channel 3:”USB SET”, the user can overwrite the software control by sliding the switch to the ‘ON’ position. The overwrite option exists for the host mode only, you cannot hardware overwrite the MUX to force device mode. 
- Channel 4: NC

### LED Indicators

The MediaTek X20 Professional Board has six LEDs.

#### Two activity LEDs

- WiFi activity LED –The MediaTek X20 Professional Board drives this Yellow LED via GPIO136, an IO from MT6797. 
- BT activity LED –The MediaTek X20 Professional Board drives this Blue LED via GPIO137, an IO from MT6797. 
 
#### Four User LEDs

The four user LEDs are surface mount Green in 0603 size located next to the micro USB connector. The MediaTek X20 Professional Board drives the four LEDs from the MT6797 GPIO: GPIO138, GPIO139, GPIO140, GPIO135.

### Additional Functionality

The MediaTek X20 Professional Board also has a additional interface (CON9001)for user debugging. It includes JTAG , UART0 and UART1 interface. The position is reserved, but the component is not mounted in the mass production. The component of CON9001 is AXT640124 produced by Panasonic. This interface should be used with the MTK debug board .

The 96Boards specification calls for a signal on the Low Speed Expansion Connector that can power on/off the board and a signal that serves as a board reset signal. 
The MediaTek X20 Professional Board routes the PWR_BTN_N (named PWRKEY on schematic) signal to the PWRKEY pin of the PMIC MT6351. This signal is driven by SW3201 as well, the on-board power on push-button switch.  A mezzanine implementation of this signals should not drive it with any voltage, the only allowed operation is to force it to GND to start the board from a sleep mode. 
The MediaTek X20 Professional Board routes the RST_BTN_N (named SYSRSTB on schematic) signal to the SYSRSTB pin of the PMIC MT6351.

### Power Supplies 

The 96Boards specification calls for three power rails to be present on the Low Speed Expansion Connector:

- +1.8V  Max of 100mA 
- +5V  Provide a minimum of 5W of power (1A). 
- SYS_DCIN  8V-18V input with enough current to support all the board functions or the output DCIN from on-board DC Connector able to provide a minimum of 7W of power. 

The MediaTek X20 Professional Board supports these requirements as follows: 

- +1.8V  Driven by PMIC MT6351 up to  1000mA.  It is the system IO power (VIO18_PMU), and it can supply power up to 200mA to the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- +5V  Driven by a 6A DC-DC buck converter (U901). It also provides the VBUS power to the two USB host connectors (CON6401, CON6402) and the HDMI 5V power to the HDMI connector (CON6501).The remaining capacity provides a max current of 2A to the Low Speed Expansion Connector, for a total of 10W which meets the 96Boards requirements. 
- SYS_DCIN  Can serves as the board’s main power source or can receive power from the board. The voltage range is from 8V to 18V.
