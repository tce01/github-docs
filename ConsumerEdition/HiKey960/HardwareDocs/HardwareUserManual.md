- The HiKey960 Development Board implements UART3 as a 4-wire UART that connects directly to the main SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.
- The HiKey960 Development Board implements UART6 as a 2-wire UART that connects directly to the main SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.


### I2C {0/1}

- The 96Boards specification calls for two I2C interfaces to be implemented on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- The HiKey960 Development Board implements both interfaces named I2C0 and I2C7. They connect directly to the Kirin960 SoC. Each of the I2C lines is pulled up to VIO18_PMU via 1K resistor.



### GPIO {A-L}

The 96Boards specification calls for 12 GPIO lines to be implemented on the Low Speed Expansion Connector. Some of these GPIOs may support alternate functions for DSI/CSI control
The HiKey960 board implements this requirement. All GPIOs are routed to the Kirin960 SoC. Take Low Speed Expansion Connector for reference.

### SPI 0

- The 96Boards specification calls for one SPI bus master to be provided on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- The HiKey960 Development Board implements a full SPI master with 4 wires, CLK, CS, MOSI and MISO. The signals are connected directly to the Kirin960 SoC and driven at 1.8V.

### I2S

- The 96Boards specification calls for one PCM/I2S bus to be provided on the Low Speed Expansion Connector. The CLK, FS and DO signals are required while the DI is optional.
- The HiKey960 Development Board implements a I2S interface with 4 wires, CLK, FS, DO and DI. The signals are connected directly to the Kirin960 SoC and driven at 1.8V.

### Power and Reset

- The HiKey960 Development Board routes the PWR_BTN_N (named PWRKEY on schematic) signal to the PWRKEY pin of the PMIC. This signal is driven by s2201 as well, the on-board power on push-button switch.  A mezzanine implementation of this signals should not drive it with any voltage, the only allowed operation is to force it to GND to start the board from a sleep mode.
- The HiKey960 Development Board routes the RST_BTN_N (named exp_rstout_n on schematic) signal to the HRESET_N pin of the PMIC Hi6421.

### Power Supplies

The 96Boards specification calls for three power rails to be present on the Low Speed Expansion Connector:
- +1.8V  Max of 100mA
- +5V  Provide a minimum of 5W of power (1A).

SYS_DCIN  8-18V input with enough current to support all the board functions or the output DCIN from on-board DC Connector able to provide a minimum of 7W of power.

The HiKey960 Development Board supports these requirements as follows:
- +1.8V  Driven by PMIC up to 150mA.
- +5V  Driven by a 5A DC-DC buck converter (U403). It also provides the VBUS power to the two USB host connectors (J1702, J1801) and the HDMI 5V power to the HDMI connector (J1901).The remaining capacity provides a total of 7W which meets the 96Boards requirements.

### MIPI DSI 0

- The 96Boards specification calls for a MIPI-DSI to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. A minimum of one lane is required and up to four lanes can be accommodated on the connector.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implementation supports a full four lane (1.2Gbps/lane) MIPI-DSI interface that is routed to the High Speed Expansion Connector. The MIPI-DSI signals are directly connected to DSI-0 of Kirin960.

### MIPI CSI {0/1}

- The 96Boards specification calls for two MIPI-CSI interfaces to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional. CSI0 interface can be up to four lanes while CSI1 is up to two lanes.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implementation supports a full four lane MIPI-CSI interface on CSI0 and two lanes of MIPI-CSI on CSI1. All MIPI-CSI signals are routed directly to/from the Kirin960 SoC.  CSI0 can support up to 26M@30fps and CSI1 can support up to 8M@30fps. The max data rate of each lane is 2.5Gbps.


### I2C {2/3}

- The 96Boards specification calls for two I2C interfaces to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional unless a MIPI-CSI interface has been implemented. Then an I2C interface shall be implemented.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implementation supports two MIPI-CSI interfaces and therefore must support two I2C interfaces,they are ISP_I2C0 and ISP_I2C1. Each of the I2C lines is pulled up to VIO18_PMU via 1K resistor.

### SD/SPI

- The 96Boards specification calls for an SD interface or a SPI port to be part of the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implements a full SPI master with 4 wires (96Boards SPI Configuration), CLK, CS, MOSI and MISO. All the signals are connected directly to the Kirin960 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.

### Clocks

- The 96Boards specification calls for one or two programmable clock interfaces to be provided on the High Speed Expansion Connector. These clocks may have a secondary function of being CSI0_MCLK and CSI1_MCLK. If these clocks can’t be supported by the SoC than an alternative GPIO or No-Connect is allowed by the specifications.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implements two CSI clocks which are connected directly to the Kirin960 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.

### USB

- The 96Boards specification calls for a USB Data line interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implements this requirement by routing USB channel 4 from the USB HUB to the High Speed Expansion Connector.

### HSIC

- The 96Boards specification calls for an optional MIPI-HSIC interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The Hikey960 Development Board implementation doesn’t support this optional requirement.

### Reserved

The pin 60 of the High Speed Expansion Connector is pulled up to VIO18_PMU via 100K resistor.
