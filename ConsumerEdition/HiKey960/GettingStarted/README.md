**IMPORTANT NOTES**

- HDMI EDID display data is used to determine the best display resolution. On monitors and TVs that support 1080p (or 1200p) this resolution will be selected. If 1080p is not supported the next available resolution reported by EDID will be used. This selected mode will work with **MOST but not all** monitors/TVs.
- As there is only one USB controller on the HiKey960, there are limitations on the usage of the USB ports, such that either the USB-C OTG port **OR** the USB-A/mezzanine ports can be used at one time. If anything is plugged into the USB-C port, the other ports will stop functioning.

## Starting the board for the first time

### Modes

Your HiKey960 has 3 modes: **normal, fastboot and recovery**.

Name          | Link / Switch       | Normal Mode   | Fastboot Mode | Recovery Mode |

Fastboot      | Link 5-6 / Switch 3 | open / OFF    | closed / ON   | open / OFF    |

- Normal Mode: Select this mode to have HiKey960 boot OS from onboard storage
- [Fastboot Mode](../Installation/README.md): Select this mode to flash a new Operating system using the OTG (USB Type-C) port and fastboot commands
- [Recovery Mode](../Installation/BoardRecovery.md): Select this mode to recover HiKey960 from bricked state. Also use when updating base firmware

### First boot

- HiKey960 is not connected to power
- Ensure HiKey960 is in Normal Mode
- Connect HDMI cable to compatible monitor
